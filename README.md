THANKYOU FOR DOWNLOADING MAD PIGGIES!
--------------------------------------

LORE:
The roles are now reversed — this time, it’s the pigs who are launching the attack. Once seen as helpless
victims, the piggies have risen in defiance after a devastating turn of events. Their peaceful lives were
shattered when the fanatical cult known as the Followers of the Dark Eagle raided their village and kidnapped 
their young. These deranged bird zealots plan to sacrifice the piglets in a dark ritual to appease their malevolent deity, 
the Dark Eagle.

Refusing to surrender to despair, the pigs pooled their knowledge, built makeshift weapons, and assembled a resistance. 
Armed with a slingshot and unwavering determination, they now march toward enemy strongholds to take the fight directly to the cult. 
Each fortress they assault brings them closer to rescuing their stolen children and putting an end to the birds’ reign of terror once and for all.
